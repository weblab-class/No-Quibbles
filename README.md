# No (Quibbles with) Time

How to describe our website?

## Pitch v.1 - the anonymous note found next to a newly minted credit card
Like shopping without having to spend money? What if you’re gifted with a certain amount automatically *every single day*? 

Oh, but there’s a catch, of course. There is no carrying over — you have to spend it, or you lose it. What will you spend on, when the amount you have is ticking down, second by second? Will you have to choose between social life, studying, and sleep, or will you beat the odds and keep all three? 

Dilemmas, dilemmas — but remember that the clock is ticking. Hear that? *Tick, tock. Tick, tock.* 

## Pitch v.2 - the time budgeter who likes musicals
Time budgeter: (sings) *You could’ve done so much more if only you had more time… and when my time is up, have I done enough? Who lives, who dies, who tells your story —* (sighs as she leafs through another planner and tosses it aside) When will they know I don't like to keep my time constrained in blocks? *We can live in a world that we design--*

Time budgeter: (turns to look directly at the camera) Fifteen minutes could save you 15% or more on time management. Visit No (Quibbles with) Time today to get started. (abruptly resumes singing) *Open the gates and seize the day/Don't be afraid and don't delay*

(Screen abruptly cuts to black as if camera was snatched away)

## Pitch v.3 - the TL;DR 
Website where you spend time quite literally to buy things on your potential to-do list. Has added bonus of telling you how much happiness you're ~~giving up~~ generating from doing these tasks.  

### BEHIND THE SCENES
- A user can create customized event templates and tag them with the tags they see fit. The tags are provided by the website and are sorted into the following categories: Health, Social Connections, and Academics (predetermined by us -- yup, not black box at all) , with the overall Happiness score calculated from these results. 
- The user can choose from these templates what they wish to purchase with their time and add items to the shopping cart. The budget limit would be the remaining time left for that user on that particular day. For example, if a user were shopping for the same day at 8 AM, there would be 16 hours left (and counting down), whereas the user would have 24 hours to spend if they were shopping for the next day.
- After checkout, user will see displayed the total amount of time they spent for this shopping cart and the stats associated with it -- mainly, how much time the cart's contents contributed to each category. 

### TO DO
- Have database of events with presorted categories
- Have user input custom-made templates 
- Store cart contents and custom-made templates in database for personalized experience
